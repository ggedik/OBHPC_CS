# OBHPC_CS
Benchmark measurements on various matrix multiplication methods. 

Hello! 


In this repository you can find information about benchmarks based on different matrix multiplication methods of which the code is written by our teacher, so the source codes provided in this repository are not mine. Although, the report and scripts to generate the graphs are and you can also find them here. 
The reduc, dgemm and dotprod files in this repository are given as you'd obtain them if you run the script separate_files.sh . Since this experiment is run on only gcc and clang compilers on a Linux environment, you need the same compilers and a Linux environment to run the script since it's written in bash, and you'll also have to install cpupower and make tools if you want to obtain your own results using this script. 

Additionnaly, 


./cible : contains information about the target arhitecture.

./datfiles : contains all .dat files produced when I run the script. 

./grphs : contains all the graphs that I produced, they will be explained in detail in the report. 



Any comment on this repository are welcome!
